# UI Component Rules
ui_components:
  usage:
    - All UI elements MUST use components from our UI component library (@/components/ui/*)
    - Direct usage of HTML elements with custom styles is NOT allowed
    - New components must be implemented in UI library before use in features
    - Every new component MUST be added to the showcase before using it
  
  implementation:
    structure:
      - Place in appropriate category folder in @/components/ui/

      - Use TypeScript types
      - Use class-variance-authority for variants
      - Include proper documentation
      - Export from category's index file
      - Add component to showcase with all variants and examples
    
    patterns:
      - Use React.forwardRef for all components
      - Implement proper prop interfaces
      - Follow consistent naming patterns
      - Include proper event handlers

      - Implement keyboard navigation
      - Include ARIA attributes
      - Support screen readers
      - Ensure color contrast
      - Add focus states

  showcase:
    - Add component to appropriate section in showcase
    - Demonstrate all variants and states
    - Include example usage with common props
    - Add proper documentation
    - Show dark mode compatibility
    - Provide code examples

# Component Showcase Rules
component_showcase:
  rules:
    - All new components must be added to the showcase page
    - Each component must demonstrate all its variants and states
    - Components must be organized in their respective sections
    - Include example usage with common props and configurations
    - Add proper documentation comments for each showcase section
  file_location: webapp/src/app/showcase/page.tsx
  sections:
    - Buttons
    - Inputs
    - Forms
    - Cards
    - Navigation
    - Feedback
    - Layout

# Best Practices
code_principles:
  solid:
    single_responsibility:
      - Each class/module should have only one reason to change
      - Split large classes into smaller, focused ones
      - Keep files under 300 lines of code
    open_closed:
      - Design for extension, not modification
      - Use interfaces and abstract classes
      - Implement new features by adding new code, not changing existing code
    liskov_substitution:
      - Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes
      - Follow interface contracts strictly
      - Avoid breaking inherited behavior
    interface_segregation:
      - Keep interfaces small and focused
      - Split large interfaces into smaller ones
      - Clients should not depend on methods they don't use
    dependency_inversion:
      - Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
      - Use dependency injection
      - Define clear interface boundaries

  kiss:
    - Keep solutions as simple as possible
    - Avoid premature optimization
    - Prefer readability over cleverness
    - Use descriptive naming over comments
    - Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts

  dry:
    - Avoid code duplication
    - Extract common functionality into shared utilities
    - Use composition over inheritance
    - Create reusable components and hooks
    - Implement shared business logic in services

file_organization:
  - Group related files together
  - Maintain consistent file structure across features
  - Keep implementation details private
  - Export only what's necessary
  - Use index files for clean imports

code_style:
  - Follow consistent naming conventions
  - Use meaningful variable and function names
  - Keep functions small and focused
  - Document public APIs and complex logic
  - Use type annotations effectively

error_handling:
  - Use typed errors for different scenarios
  - Provide meaningful error messages
  - Handle edge cases explicitly
  - Validate input data
  - Log errors appropriately

progress_tracking:
  - Update docs/PROGRESS.md whenever implementing RFC features
  - Mark items as "In Progress" when starting implementation
  - Mark items as "Completed" when passing all tests and reviews
  - Mark items as "Blocked" if dependencies or issues prevent progress
  - Add notes for blocked items explaining the blockage reason

# Dependency Management Rules
dependency_management:
  rules:
    - All new dependencies must be approved by the user before adding
    - No automatic dependency updates without user approval
    - No direct modification of package versions without user consent
    - Dependencies must be proposed with clear justification
    - Version changes must be explicitly approved
    - Lock files must not be modified without approval

# RFC 1001: Project Setup and Architecture (Web Application)

## Status
- Status: Draft
- Date: 2024-01-20
- Priority: P0 (Foundational)

## Context
FuelCare requires a solid foundation starting with the web application implementation. The architecture should be designed to later accommodate iOS and Android platforms while maintaining clean architecture principles.

## Goals
- Establish web application architecture and structure
- Set up development environment for web development
- Configure build systems for web platform
- Implement core utilities and shared components

## Detailed Design

### Technology Stack
1. Web Application (PWA)
   - React 18
   - Next.js 14
   - TailwindCSS
   - Redux Toolkit with RTK Query
   - TypeScript 5
   - React Hook Form with Zod validation

2. Development Tools
   - ESLint
   - Prettier
   - Jest
   - React Testing Library
   - Cypress for E2E testing

3. Build Tools
   - Vite
   - SWC
   - Workbox for PWA
   - Bundle Analyzer

4. Backend
   - Supabase
   - PostgreSQL
   - Edge Functions

### Core Components Setup
1. Authentication System
2. Database Schema
3. API Layer
4. Shared Components
5. Development Tools

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Web Project Setup (Week 1)
- [ ] Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
- [ ] Configure TailwindCSS and theme system
- [ ] Set up Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
- [ ] Configure development tools (ESLint, Prettier)

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure (Week 2)
- [ ] Database schema setup
- [ ] Supabase integration
- [ ] API layer foundation
- [ ] Basic shared components library

### Phase 3: Component Library (Week 3)
- [ ] Design system implementation
- [ ] Core component development
- [ ] Component documentation

### Phase 4: Development Tools (Week 4)
- [ ] Testing framework configuration
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline for web

## Security Considerations
- JWT-based authentication
- Secure data storage
- API security measures
- Environment configuration
- CORS setup
- XSS protection

## Testing Strategy
- Unit testing with Jest
- E2E testing with Cypress
- Performance testing
- Accessibility testing

## Rollout Plan
1. Development environment setup
2. Core infrastructure deployment
3. Component library release
4. Feature development start
5. Documentation and handoff

## Future Platform Considerations
- iOS application (Phase 2)
- Android application (Phase 3)
- Shared business logic extraction
- Platform-specific optimizations

## Open Questions
1. Specific browser support requirements?
2. PWA offline capabilities scope?
3. Performance benchmarks for web?
4. Analytics requirements?
